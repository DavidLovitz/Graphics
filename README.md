# Graphics
Projects from my graphics class

All programs require FPT to work:http://legacy.lclark.edu/~jeff/

Lab3.c:
Imports and draws objects with file type .xy (see examples tree.xy and treehousefrac.xy)
Clips based on a bounding box and allows for scaling and rotations of the object.

in_outS.c:
Allows you to draw a polygon (convex) and then click points, the color of the point depends on whether the points are inside or outside of the polygon. 

D2d_matrix.h & D2d_matrixS.c:
Matrix operations for multiplication, scaling, translation, rotation.
